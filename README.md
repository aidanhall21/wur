# World Ultimate Ratings

This is proof of concept for an app/website that rates ultimate frisbee teams at the Club and College levels. I chose to use 
the Bradley-Terry rating system and the algorithm code can be found in the ratings.py file.

These ratings can easily be used to simulate through tournaments and come up with win probabilities for each team. You can see the code
used to simulate the 2019 Club Mixed Nationals tournament in the montecarlo.py file.

All data was painstakingly scraped from the USAUltimate website and you can see the code for that in the scraping.py file.

I maintained a website at worldultimateratings.com from 2019-2021 built using Flask and Bootstrap which you can view the code for at worldultimate/app.py

If there's interest in me re-running and re-deploying the website using current data or if you just have some questions or would like to get into contact you 
can email me at aidanhall21 at gmail . com
